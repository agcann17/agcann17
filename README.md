Welcome. 

This is Alex Cann's GitHub Page. The projects on my GitHub must remain private for securrity reasons.
However, I am able to share them with anyone who wishes to view them, just send me an email, at 
agcann17@gmail.com, asking to if I can share the repo's and I will gladly do so. Additionally,
I can send the repo's in a zip file if that is easier. Regardless, if you wish to view my code
just ask. 

If you are viewing this through my resume, attached is a github account that has access to the information
on this page. Please use the credentials to log in and view the information.

The best way to contact me is through email. 
Sorry for the inconvenience.
