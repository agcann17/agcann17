Welcome. 

This is Alex Cann's GitHub Page. 

If you are accessing this page because of my resume, attached is a github account that has access
to all the repos on this page. Please use the credentials to log in and view the information.

The projects on my GitHub must remain private for securrity reasons. However, I am able to share 
them with anyone who wishes to view them, just send me an email, at agcann17@gmail.com, asking to 
view them and I will gladly do so. Additionally, I can send the repo's in a zip file if that is 
easier. Regardless, if you wish to view my code just ask. 

The projects below were originally done on my school GitHub account, which is why the activity feed
looks a bit wierd.

The best way to contact me is through email. 
Sorry for the inconvenience.
